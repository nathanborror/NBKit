# NBKit

NBKit is a collection of tools to make prototyping iOS apps easier.

#### Cache.swift

Cache is a dead simple way to cache objects temporarily to help reduce the amount of network requests. A great use-case is when you need to cache image data during a session.

#### JSON.swift

JSON is a collection of enums, classes and functions for parsing JSON into pre-defined structs or classes that represent the data models you're choosing to work with. It's heavly inspired by this [NSScreencast episode](http://nsscreencast.com/episodes/130-swift-json-redux-part-1).

#### Layout.swift

Layout is a more convenient way to programmatically work with [Auto-Layout](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/Introduction/Introduction.html).

#### Regex.swift

Regex is a more convenient way to work with regular expressions.
